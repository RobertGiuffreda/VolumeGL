# Physarum 3D

## Overview
This is a particle simulation using a generative algorithm designed to mimic the behavior of the Physarum polycephalum, a type of slime mold. The algorithm is described in this [paper](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579) by Jeff Jones. This program extends the generative algorithm into the third dimension.

## Examples


## Running
The program can be run using visual studio for Windows by downloading and opening the solution file. Mac and Linux are not supported at the time.
